# Connecting OneUptime to Slack

OneUptime provides deep integration with Slack, allowing you to receive notifications, manage incidents, and collaborate directly from your Slack workspace.

## Features

- **Real-time Notifications**: Get instant alerts for incidents, monitors, and scheduled maintenance
- **Channel Management**: Automatically create and manage dedicated channels for incidents
- **Interactive Actions**: Acknowledge alerts, update incident status, and manage resources directly from Slack
- **User Invitations**: Automatically invite relevant team members to incident channels
- **Status Updates**: Post status updates and communicate with your team during incidents

## Steps to Connect OneUptime to Slack

### 1. Create an Account on OneUptime
- Visit [OneUptime.com](https://oneuptime.com) and create an account.
- Once the account is created, create a new project.

### 2. Connect Slack to OneUptime Project
- Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Slack** within your OneUptime project.
- Follow the prompts to connect your Slack account with the OneUptime project.

### 3. Configure Incident Notifications
- After connecting your Slack account, go to **Incidents Page** > **Slack**.
- Add rules to send incident notifications to Slack. For example, you can create a rule that creates a new Slack channel and invites incident owners when an incident is created.

### 4. Configure Alerts and Scheduled Maintenance Notifications
- Similar rules can be applied to Alerts and Scheduled Maintenance by navigating to their respective pages and configuring the desired rules.

## Self-Hosted Installation

If you're running OneUptime on your own infrastructure, you'll need to create a custom Slack app. See our [Self-Hosted Slack Integration Guide](../self-hosted/slack-integration.md) for detailed instructions.
