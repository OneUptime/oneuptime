We have a terraform provider for OneUptime that can be generated by running the following command from the root of the OneUptime project:

```
npm run generate-and-install-terraform-provider-locally
```

Once the provider is generated, it will be installed locally. You can test it in TerraformTest directory. If the TerraformTest directory has existing state files, please delete it and run "terraform init" again.

When running terraform apply, please ensure you have added the -auto-approve flag to avoid manual approval prompts. The command should look like this:

When editing terraform files, please do not edit API key or oneuptime_url variables. 

Now, please fix this in terraform provider: 

<PROMPT>

For any fixes, please do not fix the provider code directly as this is generated code. Please fix the code where the provider is generatd.
