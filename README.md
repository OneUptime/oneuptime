### OneUptime: The Complete Open-Source Observability Platform

OneUptime is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing your online services. Whether you need to check the availability of your website, dashboard, API, or any other online resource, OneUptime can alert your team when downtime happens and keep your customers informed with a status page. OneUptime also helps you handle incidents, set up on-call rotations, run tests, secure your services, analyze logs, track performance, and debug errors.

OneUptime replaces multiple tools with one integrated platform:


#### Uptime Monitoring

Monitor the availability and response time of your online services from multiple locations around the world. Get notified via email, SMS, Slack, or other channels when something goes wrong. Replace tools like Pingdom.
