    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard for organizations
        that handle branded credit cards from the major card schemes.</p>

    <p>The PCI Standard is mandated by the card brands but administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards
        Council. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.
        Validation of compliance is performed annually or quarterly,[1] either by an external Qualified Security
        Assessor (QSA) or by a firm specific Internal Security Assessor (ISA) that creates a Report on Compliance for
        organizations handling large volumes of transactions, or by Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for companies
        handling smaller volumes. </p>
