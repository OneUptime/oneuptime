    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Information You Provide to Us. OneUptime collects information from you when you choose to provide it to us. Such
        information
        may be provided to us when you: apply for a job at OneUptime; download and install a product for evaluation;
        download
        and install a free tool; request a quote; purchase or register a product; sign up for newsletters, support

        about
        the products that you own and use, or your payment information. Such information may be required to create your

        or to complete your purchase. If you use a third party to create your account or otherwise link to us, we may
        receive
        certain information about you from the third party (such as a social network) based on your registration and
        privacy
        settings on that third party service. This information does not include tracking user behavior on our product.
    </p>
    <p>Information We May Collect. OneUptime may use cookies, web beacons, web analytics, or other technologies to
        automatically
        collect certain information about you when you visit our Website, utilize the OneUptime products, or otherwise
        interact
        with us. Please note, these may be first party cookies or tools, which are hosted within a OneUptime domain
        name, or
        third party cookies or tools, which are hosted by another party. Please reference the OneUptime Cookie Policy

        non-personal information, and information collected offline, with information collected from third party

        Real User Monitoring Service (“RUM”). OneUptime uses customized and proprietary software code to analyze and
        obtain
        information regarding how third party visitors (“Visitor”) interact with its Clients’ websites. When a Visitor
        visits
        a website that uses RUM, this code contacts OneUptime’s servers and enables OneUptime to collect and analyze the
        Visitor’s
        activity while visiting that website (“Visitor Data”). This information is stored on OneUptime’s database
        servers and
        converted to an aggregate and anonymized form to perform analyses and produce reports for its Clients.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Commitment to GDPR</h3>
    <p>On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. GDPR regulates the
        governance
        of personal data for EU citizens with an emphasis on data security and privacy. The GDPR does not only apply to
        companies
        that operate in the EU. This regulation will also impact companies operating outside of the EU if they have any
        EU
        customers or personal data of anyone in the EU.
    </p>
    <p>OneUptime Limited has made information security and data privacy foundational principles of everything we do, and
        we recognize
        the importance of passing regulations to advance information security and data privacy for citizens of the EU.
        We
        are firmly committed to GDPR readiness.
