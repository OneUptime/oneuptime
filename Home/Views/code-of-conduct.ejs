<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>Effective date: <strong><%= new Date().toLocaleString('en-US', { month: 'long', year: 'numeric' }) %></strong></p>

<p>
  The OneUptime Code of Conduct (the “Code”) sets expectations for how we conduct ourselves as a company and as
  individuals representing OneUptime. It applies to all employees, officers, directors, contractors, interns, and any
  other individuals acting on OneUptime’s behalf (collectively, “Team Members”). Adhering to this Code is a condition of
  employment or engagement with OneUptime. This Code complements, and does not replace, applicable laws, employment
  agreements, handbooks, security and privacy policies, or other internal policies. Where obligations differ, the stricter
  requirement applies.
