  <h2>Accessibility Features Implemented</h2>

  <p>OneUptime has implemented the following accessibility features throughout the application:</p>

  <h3>ARIA Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ARIA Labels:</strong> aria-labelledby, aria-label used across interactive components</li>
    <li><strong>ARIA States:</strong> aria-expanded, aria-checked, aria-pressed, aria-disabled, aria-invalid</li>
    <li><strong>ARIA Live Regions:</strong> aria-live="polite" and aria-live="assertive" for dynamic content</li>
    <li><strong>ARIA Roles:</strong> role="dialog", role="menu", role="switch", role="navigation", role="alert", role="button"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Full keyboard navigation support for interactive elements</li>
    <li>Visible focus indicators using focus ring styles</li>
    <li>TabIndex management for logical focus order</li>
    <li>Arrow key navigation in dropdown menus and autocomplete</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Screen Reader Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Screen reader-only text using sr-only class pattern</li>
    <li>Descriptive button and link text</li>
    <li>Form labels associated with inputs</li>
    <li>Status messages announced via live regions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Visual Accessibility</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>Consistent focus styles across the application</li>
    <li>Responsive design that maintains accessibility at all viewport sizes</li>
    <li>Semantic heading hierarchy</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Known Limitations and Roadmap</h2>

  <p>We are continuously working to improve accessibility. The following areas have been identified for future enhancement:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Implementing focus trapping in modal dialogs</li>
    <li>Enhancing color contrast in some secondary UI elements</li>
    <li>Adding automated accessibility testing to our CI/CD pipeline</li>
    <li>Expanding support for high contrast mode and reduced motion preferences</li>
    <li>Improving screen reader announcements for complex data visualizations</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Evaluation Methodology</h3>
  <p>This VPAT was prepared based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manual code review of React components and their ARIA implementations</li>
    <li>Analysis of Tailwind CSS accessibility classes used throughout the application</li>
    <li>Review of form components, navigation patterns, and interactive elements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We recommend conducting a full accessibility audit with assistive technology testing for comprehensive conformance verification.</p>
