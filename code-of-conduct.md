## Code of Conduct


### Code of Conduct

As contributors, maintainers, and participants in the OneUptime community, and in the interest of fostering
an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who participate or contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, attending conferences or events, or engaging in other community or project activities.

We are committed to making participation in the OneUptime community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, caste, disability, ethnicity, level of experience, family status, gender, gender identity and expression, marital status, military or veteran status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, tribe, or any other dimension of diversity.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies:
* within project and community spaces,
* in other spaces when an individual OneUptime community participant's words or actions are directed at or are about a OneUptime project, the OneUptime community, or another OneUptime community participant.

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

of managing a OneUptime project.
