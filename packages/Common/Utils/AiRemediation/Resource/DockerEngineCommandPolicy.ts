/*
 * The docker-engine command policy: tiers the docker CLI against a Docker or Podman engine (containers, images, networks, volumes, compose projects) for Docker and Podman hosts.
 *
 * A fail-closed STUB until this tool's kit lands: every command is Denied,
 * so neither investigations nor remediations can run anything through it.
 * The kit replaces this module (keeping its default export a
 * ResourceToolPolicy named "docker-engine") with the tool's real grammar.
 *
 * Part of the import-closed resource policy directory that the resource AI
 * agent carries a byte-identical copy of: relative imports of that set only.
