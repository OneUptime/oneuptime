## LetsEncrypt Cert-Manager Integration

OneUptime integrates with [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to automatically provision and manage TLS/SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt. This provides automatic certificate renewal and secure HTTPS access to your OneUptime installation.

To enable this, please set the following in your values.yaml file. 

```
cert-manager:
  enabled: true
  installCRDs: true
```

Deploy helm to enable and install CRD's and then, add these to values.yaml

```
# Let's Encrypt configuration for Cert-Manager
certManagerLetsEncrypt:
  enabled: true
  email: "test@oneuptime.com"  # Set your email for Let's Encrypt notifications
  server: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"  # Use "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory" for staging

oneuptimeIngress:
  enabled: true
  tls:
    enabled: true
    hosts:
     - host: "test.oneuptime.com" # Host 1
     # Please do not provide secretName as it'll be automatically generated. 
  className: nginx
  hosts:
    - test.oneuptime.com
```

Deploy the chart again and certificates should be provisioned. 

### Prerequisites

- Cert-Manager must be installed in your cluster (enabled via `cert-manager.enabled: true`)
- A publicly accessible domain name pointing to your ingress
- An ingress controller (like NGINX Ingress Controller) installed and configured

### Configuration

To enable automatic certificate management with Let's Encrypt:

1. **Enable Cert-Manager** in your `values.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   cert-manager:
     enabled: true
     installCRDs: true  # Installs required CRDs
   ```

2. **Configure Let's Encrypt integration**:
   ```yaml
   certManagerLetsEncrypt:
     enabled: true  # Enable Let's Encrypt certificate management
     email: "your-email@example.com"  # Required for Let's Encrypt notifications
     server: "https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"  # Production server
     # For testing, use: "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"
   ```

3. **Configure your ingress** with TLS:
   ```yaml
   oneuptimeIngress:
     enabled: true
     className: "nginx"  # Your ingress class name
     hosts:
       - "your-domain.com"
     tls:
       enabled: true
       hosts:
         - host: "your-domain.com"
           secretName: "oneuptime-tls"  # Cert-Manager will create and manage this secret
   ```

4. **Set HTTPS protocol**:
   ```yaml
   httpProtocol: https
   host: "your-domain.com"
   ```

### How It Works

When `certManagerLetsEncrypt.enabled` is set to `true`, the Helm chart will:

1. **Create a ClusterIssuer**: A Kubernetes resource that defines how to issue certificates from Let's Encrypt
2. **Annotate the Ingress**: Adds the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation to automatically request certificates
3. **Automatic Certificate Management**: Cert-Manager will:
   - Request certificates from Let's Encrypt using HTTP-01 challenges
   - Store certificates in Kubernetes secrets
   - Automatically renew certificates before expiration
   - Handle certificate lifecycle management

### Certificate Validation

Cert-Manager uses HTTP-01 challenges, which require:
- Your domain must be publicly accessible
- HTTP traffic on port 80 must reach your ingress controller
- The ingress must be configured with the correct host routing

### Troubleshooting

**Certificate not issued**:
- Check Cert-Manager pod logs: `kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager`
- Verify domain DNS resolution and ingress configuration
- Ensure the ingress class matches your controller

**Certificate stuck in pending**:
- Check challenge status: `kubectl describe challenge`
- Verify HTTP-01 challenge accessibility from external sources

**Certificate renewal issues**:
- Cert-Manager handles renewal automatically 30 days before expiration
- Check ClusterIssuer status: `kubectl describe clusterissuer`

### Alternative: Manual Certificate Management

If you prefer to manage certificates manually or use a different CA:

1. Disable Cert-Manager integration:
   ```yaml
   certManagerLetsEncrypt:
     enabled: false
   ```

2. Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, etc.) to terminate SSL/TLS
3. Configure the reverse proxy with your certificates
4. Point the reverse proxy to your OneUptime ingress
5. Set `httpProtocol: https` and update the `host` accordingly

## If you would like to use a custom domain for your status page, please add these env vars 


| Parameter | Description | Default | Change Required |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| `letsEncrypt.accountKey` | Generate a private key via openssl, encode it to base64 | `` | ðŸš¨ |
| `letsEncrypt.email` | Email address to register with letsencrypt for notifications | `` | ðŸš¨ |


## Adding a Custom Domain to your Status Page

**Step 1: Add a CNAME record to your DNS settings**

If you would like to add a custom domain to your status page (something like status.yourcompany.com), you can do so by adding a CNAME record to your DNS settings. 

```
DNS Record Type: CNAME
Host: status.yourcomapny.com
Value: <your-oneuptime-host>
```

Please make sure oneuptime is hosted on a server which is publicly accessible.

**Step 2: Add Custom Domain to your Project**

Please go to your project settings and add the custom domain to your project. You can find the project settings by clicking "More" in the nav bar and by clicking "Project Settings". Please go to "Custom Domain" page and add your custom domain there. You will need to verify the domain. You can find the verification code in the "Custom Domain" page in your project settings. 


**Step 3: Add custom domain to your status page.**

Please go to your status page settings and add the custom domain to your status page. You can find the status page settings by clicking on "View Status Page" in "Status Pages" page. You can add the custom domain in the "Custom Domain" page in your status page settings. 

Once you have added the custom domain, you can access your status page using the custom domain.

## Production Readiness Checklist

Please go through the following checklist to make sure your OneUptime installation is production ready.

- [ ] Please pin OneUptime version to a specific version. This will prevent any breaking changes from affecting your installation.

When you install, you can check the latest version from the github releases page https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/releases. You can pin the version in your values.yaml file.

```
image:
  tag: <specific-version>
```

- [ ] Please pin OneUptime, PostgreSQL,Redis, and ClickHouse versions to a specific version. This will prevent any breaking changes from affecting your installation.

When you install, you can check the version installed by describing the pods. 

```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

For example: 

```
kubectl describe pod my-oneuptime-postgresql-0
```

Once you have the version, you can pin the version in your values.yaml file.

```
postgresql:
  image:
    tag: <specific-version>
redis:
  image:
    tag: <specific-version>
clickhouse:
  image:
    tag: <specific-version>
```

- [ ] Please make sure you have backups enabled for your PVCs. This is outside the scope of this chart. Please refer to your cloud provider's documentation on how to enable backups for PVCs.
- [ ] Please make sure you have static passwords for your database passwords (for Redis, ClickHouse and PostgreSQL).
- [ ] Please set `oneuptimeSecret` and `encryptionSecret` (or setup in `externalSecrets` section) to a long random string. You can use a password generator to generate these strings.
- [ ] Please set `probes.<key>.key` to a long random string. This is used to secure your probes.
- [ ] Please regularly update OneUptime. We release updates every day. We recommend you to update the software at least once a week if you're running OneUptime production. 

## Releases 

We release frequently, sometimes multiple times a day. It's usually safe to upgrade to the latest version. Any breaking changes will be documented in the release notes. Please make sure you read the release notes before upgrading.
